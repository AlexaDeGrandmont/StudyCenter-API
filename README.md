# üè´ Study Center - Backend

## Overview

The Carleton Computer Science Study Center is a student led project to expand on Carleton's current <a href="http://cglab.ca/~discmath/"> Discrete Math Study Center website</a> and transform it into a responsive multiplatform app. In it's current state, the existing website only has content for a single course and the website itself is incapable with mobile devices. The goal of this project is increase the accesibility of the content of other computer science courses at Carleton and build an easy to use platform so additional content can continously be added.

This is the API for the Study Center Project. It's goal is to serve course content such as past questions and quizzes to users.

## Tech Stack

- **Ruby on Rails**: Choosen for rapid development speed. This application is an API only Rails app.
- **GraphQL**: Choosen to later serve the exact data needs of specific client types when this app starts to serve multiple platforms.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and user session management.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database. Choosen because Postgres is the database all students learn in the COMP3005 course.
- **RSpec**: Testing Framework.

## Demo

There is currently a very rough demo being hosted via heroku. The API is being hosted with heroku free hosting and therefore takes up to 25 seconds to load data.
